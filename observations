1. preallocation - true/false (false, as of now)
2. format - pq/ipc_zstd/ipc_lz4
3. on wire compression - lz4/zstd
4. parallel decompression - true/false (false, as of now)

on wire use zstd for more than 50% and lz4 for less than 50%
best performing pair is lz4 ipc on disk + wire compression as above for now.
